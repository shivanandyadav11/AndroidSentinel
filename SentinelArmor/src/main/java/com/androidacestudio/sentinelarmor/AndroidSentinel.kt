/**
 * AndroidSentinel
 *
 * This interface defines the core functionality for performing security analysis on Android applications.
 * It serves as the main entry point for the SentinelArmor security analysis toolkit.
 *
 * The AndroidSentinel is designed to encapsulate various security checks and provide a unified
 * way to analyze potential security flaws in an Android application. Implementations of this
 * interface should conduct thorough examinations of different aspects of app security, including
 * but not limited to:
 *
 * - Permissions analysis
 * - Cryptography usage
 * - Network security configurations
 * - Data storage practices
 * - Component exposure (e.g., Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers)
 * - WebView configurations
 * - Native code security
 *
 * Usage:
 * Typically, an instance of AndroidSentinel would be created through a factory method or dependency
 * injection, configured with the necessary context or parameters, and then used to perform the
 * security analysis.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val sentinel: AndroidSentinel = SentinelArmorFactory.create(context)
 * val securityIssues = sentinel.analyzeSecurityFlaws()
 * securityIssues.forEach { issue ->
 *     // Handle or report each security issue
 * }
 * ```
 * @see SecurityIssue
 * @see SentinelArmorFactory

    /**
     * Analyzes the Android application for potential security flaws.
     *
     * This method performs a comprehensive security analysis of the Android application,
     * examining various aspects of the app's configuration, code, and resource usage to
     * identify potential vulnerabilities or security misconfigurations.
     *
     * The analysis typically includes checks for:
     * - Insecure data storage
     * - Weak cryptography usage
     * - Exposed components
     * - Insecure network configurations
     * - Improper permission usage
     * - WebView vulnerabilities
     * - And other security-related issues
     *
     * @return A list of [SecurityIssue] objects, each representing a detected security flaw.
     *         The list will be empty if no security issues are detected.
     *
     * Note: This method may take a considerable amount of time to execute, depending on the
     * size and complexity of the application being analyzed. It's recommended to run this
     * method in a background thread to avoid blocking the main thread in Android applications.
